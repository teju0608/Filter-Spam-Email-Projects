# Filter-Spam-Email-Projects
If you have used Gmail, Yahoo, or any other email service, you would have noticed that some emails are automatically marked as spam by email engines. These spam email detectors are based on rule-based and statistical machine learning approaches.

Spam email filtering is a text classification task, where based on the text of the email, we have to classify whether or not an email is a spam email. Supervised machine learning is commonly used for classification, particularly if the true outputs are available in the dataset.

The Naïve Bayes Algorithm is one of the supervised machine learning algorithms that have been proven to be effective for spam email detection. In this project, you will see how to detect spam emails using the Naïve Bayes algorithm implemented via Python’s Sklearn library.
